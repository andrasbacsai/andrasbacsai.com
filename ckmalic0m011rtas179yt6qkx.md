## Celebrate every little success, no exceptions!

In this quickly advancing world, we often forgot to celebrate our achievements, especially during COVID. Your head is probably full of problems, and you totally forgot the good things.

> Mine as well. I'm home (and lockdown) with my family of four (4, 8 years old) for a month. We live in a medium-sized apartment, where I do not have a separate room to work from, so I'm working from the living room (sometimes madness 🤯).

# Celebrate tiny things!
To overcome all the difficulties, I celebrate more and more things than I used to. It helps a lot, not just me, but my family. If dad or mom is happier, everybody is happier. 😉

> An example: I wrote this blog post in ~30 mins, even though I only had its title when I started. (I spend mostly 1-2 hours for a post. My writing skill is definitely improving! 🎉)

# It's so cliche!
Yeah, it is. And that's why it works!

Waiting for a huge success to happen in your life makes you burnout pretty quickly. The time gap between them could be enormous. So doing it more frequently and constantly changes everything!

# How to define success?
It's not the same for everybody. It could be as small as making a perfect coffee that you really enjoy drinking (Hey, it's me 😁) to making thousands of dollars on the internet (Not me 😄).

You have to think small! Really small! (*Grammarly help me to find a synonym!*) Miniature!

# But how?
Simple. Write down what you have achieved today, last week on a simple paper. You will feel way better, and you probably recognize that you are doing more than you first think of!

I have been using [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/), a web app that helps you share what you've done today as a developer. 

Simple and but still a huge idea, because it helps you be consistent (you are getting streaks for every day you have done something), and people could praise you!

(Try it, and you will see!)
