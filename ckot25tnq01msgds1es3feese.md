## The small decision, the big change.

#  Hey 👋
It's been a while since my last post. So many things have happened since then.

- Released 8 new versions of [Coolify](https://coolify.io).
- Talked to a lot of interesting people on Twitter!
- Had a small giveaway on Twitter of [Sara Vieira's](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW) book called [Opinionatedreact](https://opinionatedreact.com) - Worth reading!
- Contacted by other VCs to have a chat about Coolify (still not interested in VCs, sorry).

But there was an even more important thing that happened.

# Thinking about services 🤔

You probably know that with Coolify, next to the application/database deployments, I also would like to make services to be easily installable and manageable on your own servers. But since I've published the first version, there were no services available. Until now!

When I started thinking of Coolify, I thought of services like apps that I personally write. Why? I love coding, so why not?

I was thinking of creating an user analytics tool, which is privacy-focused, super lightweight embed script on the frontend, pretty charts, open-source, self-hostable. I had already written this before when I was still working at my previous job, but I had to take it down, because of some [reasons...](https://andrasbacsai.com/why-did-i-leave-my-stable-job-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic).

# So let's get started, right? 🤩

Yes and no. I'm following [Marko Saric](https://twitter.com/markosaric) since he and [Uku Täht](https://twitter.com/ukutaht) since they started doing [Plausible Analytics](https://twitter.com/PlausibleHQ). They have a similar niche as me!

And one day, it struck in my mind like a lightning strike: They are literally doing the same!! Privacy-focused, lightweight embed script, pretty charts, etc.
 
Why wouldn't I create a button that will magically install an instance of it??
(I love one-click buttons that do a lot of things behind the scenes. 😁)

# Decision made! 👍

If there is already a solution for a specific problem out in the wildness, which stands for the same principles as [coolLabs](https://coollabs.io): why should I spend time to recreate a similar one? With this thinking, I could focus on creating applications that do not have already available with these principles.

# Conclusion 🏁
I will focus more on executing my vision than some selfish thing to write every application myself!
