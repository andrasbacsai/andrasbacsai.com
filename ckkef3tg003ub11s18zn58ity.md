## Farewell Netlify & Heroku, after 3 days of coding? 🤯

## I'm shipping a side-project! 🎉

> Disclaimer: The first version was created in 3 days of coding. It was a simple webhook endpoint. This version took a bit more time, so **sorry for the catchy title**. 🙃 

## It's called: Coolify

%[https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify]

### What? Coolify?

It's an open-source, hassle-free, self-hostable Heroku & Netlify alternative. It helps you focus on code and forget about the infrastructure part by building & deploying code from Git directly to your own server.

### What's the problem with Netlify & Heroku?

Nothing. They are pretty awesome products! Use them as much as you could!

But if you would like to control the infrastructure part, you cannot use them, unfortunately. 

### Who is the target audience?
- Hobbyists.
- Indiehackers.
- Developers.
- Literally, anybody who would like to start publishing apps.

### But it cannot host my app in a scalable way as Netlify & Heroku could!

**You do not need to scalable environment to start doing a side-project. A simple server is totally enough! 
**

> By the way, it will be possible to do scalable environments with it later on. 😉

### What features does it have?

You can read it on this simple [landing page](https://coollabs.io/coolify).

### What are your plans with Coolify?

There are plenty of cool features on my table (see [landing page](https://coollabs.io/coolify)).

And probably at some point in the future, I would like to provide a paid version - no promises here. 

### Why did I start working on this?

Well. I like making things.


**WARNING**: It's still in beta, but I would like to ship it as soon as possible, without overthinking everything - as a mostly do. 😁


** I'm not used to shipping things, and I would like to change this!**
