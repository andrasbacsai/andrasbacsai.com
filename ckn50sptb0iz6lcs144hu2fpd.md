## I've set HackerNews on fire 🔥 How I did it?

I never thought I ever do such a thing. It was an outstanding feeling! 😀

If you are still here, you can read the full story below. Enjoy - **I guess**; you will understand why I'm saying this.

# Sunny morning ☀

The day started as a normal day. Woke up, take care of kids, one in home-school, the other one in home-kindergarten, my wife home-working as well as me - you know, just a normal day during lockdown and this COVID thing what everybody talks about. 

Working normally with a laptop on my lap, trying to code, talking with colleagues with one hand, and building a toy train with my other hand. 💻 📱🚄

Everything was OK until someone called me on the phone in the afternoon.

# Cloudy afternoon ⛈

It was my mom. One of my relatives was between life and death due to COVID. I was shocked. I know she got symptoms a week before, but not that she is in this terrible state. I was shattered. 

# Why is this related to the fire 🔥? 

While I was in this state, I decided to start doing something because I could not help her, so I would like to think of something else.

Started coding -> It was painful - I could not concentrate.

Started reading things online -> Kinda distracts me and my brain from the situation. 

I ended up on HackerNews, reading through submissions. 

And the like a lightning strike from nowhere. ⚡

# What if I post Coolify?

So yeah, that's how it happened. I decided to post Coolify because why not? 
Without any prior research/marketing/followers/blabla/anything, like when to post it to get more attention (timezones), how to write a catchy title (it already has one btw), etc.

**Just posted it.**

# What happened next?

It literally blew up! 💥 

Why? No idea. After an hour or two, It was still going up, like a train.

** It was in the top 5 for 20+hours **

I wasn't ready for this. Especially not mentally. Answering comments - and especially negative ones - were not what I would like to do in this state. But I somehow managed it.

It boosted my feeling pretty much.

# Conclusion

What I learned by publishing Coolify to the world and posting on HackerNews could be summarized in one tiny e-book... I wonder how long it does take to write it down. 🤔

Oh, wait. I already did it! And it's FREE! 😁

# What happened on the next days?

Not just my online presence has grown a bit, but these happened as well, which are insane!

And you won't believe this.

I even got an email from an **American venture capital** to tell me about my vision of Coolify and talk about a partnership. 🤯
